        <li><strong>Three month internship</strong> in Research Engineering at the <a href="https://www.turing.ac.uk">Alan Turing Institute</a>, where I developed some <a href="https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/alexa-room-finder">Alexa Skills</a>, did some cool stuff with neonatal intensive care data, and made <a href="http://gamma.turing.ac.uk">things</a> for <a href="https://thegamma.net/">The Gamma</a>: an amazing project for open data viz in journalism. I was cited as an author on a <a href="http://rse.ac.uk/conf2017/talk-abstracts/#curating-datasets-for-development-of-automated-data-wrangling-tools-">talk</a> at <a href="http://rse.ac.uk">#RSE2017</a>.</li>
        <li><strong>One month internship at <a href="https://www.gama.com/">GAMA</a></strong>: a hedge fund based in Singapore, where I researched Asian chemical companies, nuclear power, and aluminium production.</li>
        <li><strong>Two week internship at <a href="http://www.adaptimmune.com/">Adaptimmune</a></strong>: a biotechnology company in the UK, researching affinity-enhanced T Cells to fight cancer. I worked in their protein laboratory.</li>

      <div class="section">• SOME ACADEMICS •</div>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>University:</strong> <a href="https://stanford.edu">Stanford</a>, where I&#39;m in the class of 2017-2021. I hope to major in some combination of Computer Science and Mathematics.</li>
        <li><strong>GPA:</strong> 4.174 - and 4.3 in my CS major.</li>
        <li><strong>Courses I've taken</strong> include Mathematical Foundations of Computing (A+), Programming Abstractions (A+), and Linear Algebra/Differential Calculus (A+). I've also done a bunch of interesting History classes, covering Sovereignty (A+), Modern China (A), and the Crusades (A).</li>
        <li><strong>Secondary School:</strong> <a href="http://etoncollege.com/">Eton</a>, where I was a King&#39;s Scholar.</li>
        <li><strong>Five A*s at A Level:</strong> Mathematics, Further Mathematics, Physics, Chemistry, and History.</li>
        <li><strong>Thirteen A*s at GCSE.</strong></li>
        <li><strong>Primary School:</strong> <a href="http://dragonschool.org/">The Dragon</a>, where I won the Nicholas Knatchbull medal for top scholar.</li>
        <li>At Eton, I won five of a possible seven <strong>overall trials prizes</strong>. Here&#39;s what Eton has to say about &#39;Trials&#39;:</li>
        <blockquote>&quot;Eton calls its internal examinations &#39;Trials&#39;. [...] The headmaster reads the names of boys who have achieved merits and distinctions in trials [...] and <em>perhaps, if one boy has distinguished himself above all others, an overall trials prize.</em>&quot;<br/>
          - <a href="http://www.etoncollege.com/trials.aspx"><em>Eton College, 2017</em></a></blockquote>
      </ul>
      <p style="text-align:center"><strong>If you're a university interested in national tests/challenges, I included a few below. Otherwise skip this!</strong></p>
      <ul style="font-size:13px">
        <li>I took part in the <a href="https://bmos.ukmt.org.uk/home/bmo.shtml">British Mathematical Olympiad</a> three times, which is only taken by the top ~1000 mathematicians under 19 each year (based off the Senior Maths Challenge). I received a distinction in the 2016 BMO.</li>
        <li>I received gold in the <a href="http://www.rsc.org/campaigning-outreach/outreach/educators/uk-chemistry-olympiad/">UK Chemistry Olympiad</a>, and did well enough that my paper was sent for moderation by the RSC. I also received a moderated gold in the similar <a href="http://www.c3l6.org/about">C3L6</a>.</li>
        <li>I got into and attended the <a href="http://www-spc.phy.cam.ac.uk/">Senior Physics Challenge</a>, an examined Physics Summer school at Cambridge University.</li>

      <div class="section">• SOME SKILLS •</div>
      <p>Eton didn&#39;t teach Computer Science ☹, but I taught myself, and am now doing it at at Stanford.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>A lot of experience in <code>Python</code>, <code>Java</code> (particularly <code>Android</code>), <code>F#</code>, <code>HTML/CSS</code>, <code>Javascript</code> (particularly <code>Node</code>), <code>Clojure</code> (my fave), and <code>C/C++</code>.</li>
        <li>I'm a very solid <code>Alexa Skill</code> developer. I won <a href="https://devpost.com/software/memorium">Best Voice Experience for Alexa</a> at Treehacks, and I'm a contributor to their SDK. I learnt to use AWS along the way. If you have a cool idea for a conversational interface, just get in touch.</li>
        <li>Extensive experience in <code>Adobe InDesign</code>, as well as plenty of experience in <code>Photoshop</code> and <code>Illustrator</code>.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>I&#39;ll try to pick up any required programming language pretty quickly though.
      <ul>
        <li>Speaking of languages, my <strong>Spanish</strong> is reasonable. I spent some of my Gap year living in Argentina.</li>
        <li>I'm also a qualified <strong>Emergency First Responder</strong> (that's CPR, AED, and First Aid stuff).</li>
      </ul>

      <div class="section">• SOME LEADERSHIP •</div>
      <ul>
        <li>I was a member of Sixth Form Select: a group of the best academics at Eton. Here&#39;s how Wikipedia describes it:</li>
        <blockquote>&quot;An academically selected prefectorial group consisting, by custom, of the 10 senior King&#39;s Scholars and the 10 senior Oppidan Scholars. Members of Sixth Form Select are entitled to wear silver buttons on their waistcoats.&quot;<br/>
          - <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eton_College#Prefects"><em>Wikipedia, 2018</em></a></blockquote>
        <li>I was also keeper of Eton&#39;s Scientific, History, and Essay <a href="http://www.etoncollege.com/Societies2.aspx">societies</a>, inviting speakers such as Nobel Prize winner <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tim_Hunt">Tim Hunt</a>.</li>
        <li>I was <strong>chief editor and designer of the academic yearbook</strong>; chief editor of the school science magazine; and editor/designer of the general school magazine. Many hours were spent in InDesign!</li>
      </ul>

      <div class="section">• SOME HOBBIES •</div>
      <blockquote>&quot;Your employer <em>definitely</em> wants to know all about your hobbies.&quot;<br/>
      - <em>Nobody, 2018</em></blockquote>
      <p>I'm in O-Tone: Stanford's East Asian A Cappella group. I love Asia, and particularly Asian history. I'm an extreme sports junkie: I&#39;m a PADI divemaster, and I have my paragliding license. (I've accidentally landed in a lake more than once though...) I love puzzle and board games of all varieties: my favourites are Shenzhen I/O and The Witness. I'm in the Chemistry fraternity.</p>
